# For details on buf.yaml configuration, visit https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-yaml
# IMPORTANT: This is a v2 buf.yaml, not v1. See: buf migrating to v2 https://buf.build/docs/migration-guides/migrate-v2-config-files/
# See files and packages https://buf.build/docs/reference/protobuf-files-and-packages/
version: v2
# The v2 buf.yaml file specifies a local workspace, which consists of at least one module.
# The buf.yaml file should be placed at the root directory of the workspace, which
# should generally be the root of your source control repository.
modules:
  # Each module entry defines a path, which must be relative to the directory where the
  # buf.yaml is located. You can also specify directories to exclude from a module.
  - path: proto
    # Modules can also optionally specify their Buf Schema Repository name if it exists.
    name: buf.build/zackiles/postgres-proto-schema
# Dependencies shared by all modules in the workspace. Must be modules hosted in the Buf Schema Registry.
# The resolution of these dependencies is stored in the buf.lock file.
deps:
  - buf.build/bufbuild/protovalidate # The latest accepted commit.
# The default lint configuration for any modules that don't have a specific lint configuration.
#
# If this section isn't present, AND a module doesn't have a specific lint configuration, the default
# lint configuration is used for the module.
lint:
  use:
    - STANDARD
# Default breaking configuration. It behaves the same as the default lint configuration.
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
# Optional Buf plugins. Can use to require custom lint or breaking change rules specified in a locally
# installed plugin. Each Buf plugin is listed separately, and can include options if the plugin allows
# for them. If a rule has its `default` value set to true, the rule will be checked against even if
# the 'lint' and 'breaking' fields aren't set.

# See the example at https://github.com/bufbuild/bufplugin-go/blob/main/check/internal/example/cmd/buf-plugin-timestamp-suffix/main.go
# for more detail about the sample below.
#plugins:
#  - plugin: plugin-timestamp-suffix # Specifies the installed plugin to use
#    options:
#      # The TIMESTAMP_SUFFIX rule specified above allows the user to change the suffix by providing a
#      # new value here.
